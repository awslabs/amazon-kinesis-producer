/**
 * If you haven't looked at {@link SampleProducer}, do so first.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As mentioned in SampleProducer, we will check that all records are received
 * correctly by the KCL by verifying that there are no gaps in the sequence
 * numbers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As the consumer runs, it will periodically log a message indicating the
 * number of gaps it found in the sequence numbers. A gap is when the difference
 * between two consecutive elements in the sorted list of seen sequence numbers
 * is greater than 1.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Over time the number of gaps should converge to 0. You should also observe
 * that the range of sequence numbers seen is equal to the number of records put
 * by the SampleProducer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the stream contains data from multiple runs of SampleProducer, you should
 * observe the SampleConsumer detecting this and resetting state to only count
 * the latest run.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note if you kill the SampleConsumer halfway and run it again, the number of
 * gaps may never converge to 0. This is because checkpoints may have been made
 * such that some records from the producer's latest run are not processed
 * again. If you observe this, simply run the producer to completion again
 * without terminating the consumer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The consumer continues running until manually terminated, even if there are
 * no more records to consume.
